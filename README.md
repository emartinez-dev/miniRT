# miniRT
The goal of this program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. 
Those computer-generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.


## Arguments
A scene in format `*.rt`

## Allowed functions

- open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit
- All functions of the math library (`-lm man man 3 math`)
- All functions of the MinilibX
